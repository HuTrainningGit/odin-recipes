            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Place sliced potatoes in a medium bowl and cover with cold water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper together in a separate medium bowl. 
                    Add milk and egg; stir until batter is smooth. Let stand for 20 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, heat oil in a large pot or electric skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drain and pat dry potatoes. Fry in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes; drain on paper towels.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dredge cod in batter, one piece at a time, and place in hot oil. 
                    Fry fish in batches until golden brown on all sides; drain on paper towels. 
                    Monitor oil temperature, increasing the heat as needed to maintain 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fry potatoes again in hot oil until crisp, 1 to 2 minutes; drain on paper towels.
                </li>
            </ol>
